This is Mini Yahtzee game done with React Native. It uses hooks to manage state and the "react-native" library to render the UI. The component contains several constants that define the game parameters, such as the number of dice, the number of throws allowed, and the number of scoreboard rows. It also imports an icon library, "MaterialCommunityIcons," which is used to display the dice and buttons. This is part of the Mobile Programming course.
